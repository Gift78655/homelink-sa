🧱 WEEK 1: SETUP AND AUTHENTICATION
✅ 1. Project Setup
Objective: Lay the groundwork for your full-stack app.

Actions:
Initialize React Project

bash
Copy
Edit
npx create-react-app homelink-sa
cd homelink-sa
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
Add Tailwind to ./src/index.css:

css
Copy
Edit
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
Firebase Project Setup

Go to Firebase Console

Create a project named homelink-sa

Enable:

Authentication

Firestore Database

Storage

CI/CD Deployment (Render/Vercel)

Push your repo to GitHub.

Link it to Render or Vercel.

Enable automatic deployment from the main branch.

✅ 2. Authentication Module
Objective: Enable secure user logins and role assignment.

Actions:
Install Firebase SDK

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install firebase
Firebase Auth Logic (/firebase/config.js)

js
Copy
Edit
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getAuth } from "firebase/auth";
import { getFirestore } from "firebase/firestore";
import { getStorage } from "firebase/storage";

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "XXXX",
  authDomain: "XXXX",
  projectId: "XXXX",
  storageBucket: "XXXX",
  messagingSenderId: "XXXX",
  appId: "XXXX",
};

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
export const auth = getAuth(app);
export const db = getFirestore(app);
export const storage = getStorage(app);
Signup/Login UI

Use email/password (plus optional Google OAuth).

On signup, ask user: Are you a Homeowner or Service Provider?

Store user role in Firestore

js
Copy
Edit
await setDoc(doc(db, "users", uid), {
  email: user.email,
  role: "provider", // or "homeowner"
  createdAt: serverTimestamp(),
});
✅ 3. Provider Onboarding
Objective: Let service providers submit their profile and upload docs.

Actions:
Create onboarding form:

Name, Services Offered

Location (city/suburb)

Upload: ID, Proof of Certification

Description, Experience

Store uploads in Firebase Storage:

js
Copy
Edit
const storageRef = ref(storage, `docs/${uid}/idProof.pdf`);
await uploadBytes(storageRef, file);
Admin approval system:

Admin marks providers as "isVerified": true in Firestore

Only verified providers can appear in listings or accept bookings

✅ 4. UI Pages
Pages to Build:

/login: login/register toggle

/dashboard/homeowner: Homeowner main panel

/dashboard/provider: Provider dashboard (availability, bookings, etc.)

Add role-based redirect after login:

js
Copy
Edit
if (role === "provider") navigate("/dashboard/provider");
else navigate("/dashboard/homeowner");
🔚 Deliverables for Week 1
✅ React app initialized with Tailwind

✅ Firebase connected (Auth + Firestore + Storage)

✅ Signup/login with role selection

✅ Firestore user profile storage

✅ Provider onboarding form with document upload

✅ Admin flag system for provider verification

✅ Skeleton dashboard routes with redirects

🎯 Focus Areas:
Booking Calendar System

Emergency Toggle

Geolocation-Based Matching

UI Components to Support These Features

✅ 1. Booking System with Availability Calendar
Frontend:
Use FullCalendar.js or React Big Calendar

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install @fullcalendar/react @fullcalendar/daygrid
Provider Flow:

Providers log in and mark available time slots.

Store availability under:

bash
Copy
Edit
/availability/{providerId}/[timestamp]: true
Homeowner Flow:

Display calendar UI showing available time slots per provider.

On slot selection:

Save booking to Firestore:

js
Copy
Edit
/bookings/{bookingId}:
{
  providerId,
  homeownerId,
  timestamp,
  status: "pending"
}
Booking Confirmation:

Status flow: "pending" → "confirmed" → "completed"

Trigger confirmation via email or in-app notification.

✅ 2. Emergency Service Toggle
Provider Panel:
Add a switch/toggle:

js
Copy
Edit
/users/{uid}.isEmergencyReady = true
User Flow:
On "Emergency Request" checkbox:

Filter providers who have:

js
Copy
Edit
isEmergencyReady === true
Notify available emergency providers immediately (email or push):

Use Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)

✅ 3. Geolocation Integration
Frontend:
Get user’s location via browser:

js
Copy
Edit
navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition((position) => {
  const { latitude, longitude } = position.coords;
});
Use Google Maps API to reverse-geocode the user’s location:

https
Copy
Edit
https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?latlng={lat},{lng}&key=YOUR_API_KEY
Proximity Filtering:
Option A: Firebase + GeoFire

Store provider locations in GeoFire format

Query by radius (e.g. 5km, 10km)

js
Copy
Edit
geoQuery = geoFire.query({ center: [lat, lng], radius: 10 });
Option B: MongoDB + Geospatial Index

If using custom backend:

Add 2dsphere index on provider coordinates

Use $near query to fetch nearby providers

✅ 4. UI Components for Week 2
Page/Component	Function
BookingCalendar.js	Displays availability calendar for providers
EmergencyToggle.js	Provider switch to mark “Emergency Ready”
FindProvider.js	Homeowner view with map and filtered providers
NearbyMapView.js	Map showing providers near user location

📦 Firestore Suggested Schema (simplified)
bash
Copy
Edit
/users/{uid}
  ├─ role: "provider" | "homeowner"
  ├─ isEmergencyReady: true
  ├─ location: { lat, lng }

/availability/{providerId}
  ├─ {timestamp}: true

/bookings/{bookingId}
  ├─ providerId
  ├─ homeownerId
  ├─ time
  ├─ status: "pending" | "confirmed" | "completed"
🔚 Deliverables for Week 2
✅ Booking calendar system in place

✅ Providers define and store availability

✅ Homeowners can book a time slot

✅ Emergency-ready toggle and query filtering

✅ Geolocation-based provider display (map or list)

✅ UI components for availability, emergency mode, and map integration

📅 WEEK 3: PAYMENTS, CHAT, REVIEWS, POLISH
🎯 Focus Areas:
Secure Mobile Payments

In-App Real-Time Chat

Ratings & Reviews

UI Enhancements & Deployment

✅ 1. Secure Mobile Payments
Integration Options:
Stripe (global, card-focused)

Paystack (ideal for South Africa/Nigeria; supports EFT & mobile money)

Workflow:
User books → payment initiated.

Payment processed → funds held in escrow.

Job marked "completed" → funds released to provider.

Commission optionally deducted (e.g., 10%).

Implementation:
Use Stripe Checkout or Paystack Inline

Store payments in Firestore:

bash
Copy
Edit
/payments/{paymentId}
  ├─ userId
  ├─ providerId
  ├─ bookingId
  ├─ amount
  ├─ status: "pending" | "paid" | "released"
Admin Dashboard:
Track all payments and releases.

Approve/trigger manual releases if needed.

✅ 2. In-App Chat
Options:
Firebase Realtime DB (quickest)

Socket.io (if using Node backend)

Basic Schema (Firebase RTDB):
json
Copy
Edit
/chats/{bookingId}/messages
[
  {
    senderId: "uid1",
    message: "Hello",
    timestamp: "2025-05-18T15:00:00"
  }
]
Features:
Chat per booking

Show unread indicator

Real-time updates

Notifications (optional: Firebase Cloud Messaging)

Optional:
Integrate Jitsi Meet or Daily.co for video calls.

✅ 3. Ratings and Reviews
Trigger:
After booking is marked completed

User Flow:
Homeowner is prompted to rate:

⭐ 1 to 5 stars

Comment (optional)

Stored under:

bash
Copy
Edit
/reviews/{providerId}/{reviewId}
  ├─ userId
  ├─ rating: 5
  ├─ comment: "Excellent work!"
  ├─ timestamp
Display:
Show on provider profile

Aggregate rating: average of all reviews

Filter providers by rating
